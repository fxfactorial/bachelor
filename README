The main purpose of this project is to implement some of the most common
mathematical attacks on the RSA cipher, and provide an executable capable of
measuring the level of security into a ssl conversation.

Given a website as input, the program should be able to download its
certificate, and probe it with different tools.

Examples of probes could be wrong information on the ssl certificate metadata,
a vulnerability with wiener's attack, factorization, dixon, etc.
