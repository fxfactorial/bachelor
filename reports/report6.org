Finalizing and testing a serial version of fermat's factorization, but most of
the time were spent on the writing of the final document. Summarizing down here
the current status of each attack candidate:

* DIXON
  Must be completely rewritten, the initial implementation was far too naive,
  and I don't have many sources, neither simple enough, nor complete to use at
  the moment.
* FERMAT
  Working and tested serial version
* WIENER
  WOrking and tested serial verision
* POLLARD p-1
  Was completed, but turns out also this one shall be almostly rewritten.
* POLLAPRD p+1
  To be studied and written
* POLLARD œÅ
  To be studied and written
