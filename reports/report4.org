This fourth week has not got any consistent update. I just reached a working
implementation of Pollard's (p-1) algorithm. I believe it can still be optimied,
yet there are some sources given by Emanuele I have to read/study.

* DONE Complete and test Pollard's (p-1) factorization.
  See 773c479543acda096e83e625124284f for further informations.
* DOING Studying an upper limit for the iterations in Wiener.
  "Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem" claims that the algorithms
  is linear, that's jsut about log N iterations; looking at the proof to
  understand why.
